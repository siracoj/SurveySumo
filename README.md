# SurveySumo

Survey Sumo is a web application that allows you to create survey questions and serve them to potential users never allowing the same user to answer the same question twice.

==========================================================================================

Requirements:

Create a simple Django Survey app using MySQL.

The app should allow an admin to enter survey questions with multiple choice answers.

When a guest visits the app in a browser it should present a random survey question to the guest and allow them to answer.

Record answers and display the survey results in an admin interface.

Avoid showing a previously answered question to the same guest.

Make sure the UI is mobile browser friendly and we can run it in a test environment.

Provide a clear README with instructions on how to setup and run the app.

Create a github.com repository with the app that we can pull from and test.
